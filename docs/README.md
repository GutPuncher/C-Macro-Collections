# docs

In this folder is located a backup of the markdown used to generate the C Macro Collections documentation. It is kept relative to slate folder structure. The main markdown is located at `source/index.html.md` and the documentation for each collection is at `source/includes`. There is a file at `source/stylesheets` with name `custom.css.scss` where I added custom CSS to the page and its content should be appended to any `.scss` file in the slate project.
